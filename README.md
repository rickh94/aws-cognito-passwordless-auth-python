# AWS Cognito Passwordless Auth
This is a proof of concept for passwordless authentication using aws cognito. 
I was just playing around. I'm pretty sure I just re-implemented their javascript
example code in python with a little passwordless.

If it is useful to you, feel free to use it! However, I will warn that I **never got
around to writing the tests.** If you're going to use it in production, you really should
do that...running untested authentication code in production sounds like a *really* bad
time.

It's also mostly two-year-old code and serverless framework has changed quite a bit since then.
